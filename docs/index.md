# BREADS

This is the documentation for the _Broadly Expandable and Reconfigurable Data Acquisition and Automation Device Specification_ (BREADS). Check out [feastorg.github.io/BREADS](https://feastorg.github.io/BREADS/) where these docs are hosted for easy access.

## What is BREADS?

- Specifies mechanical form factor and connector pinout
- Defines power distribution and signal bus conventions
- Supports scalable, stackable, and distributed systems

## Planned implementations

- SLICE function cards
  - Single-function Logic Interface Controller Element
- LOAF controller + backplanes
  - Local Operations Attachment Frame
- CRUST interface bridges
  - Configurable Routing & Universal Signal Translator
  - Makes non-SLICE devices SLICE compliant with BREAD
